            Powder-coated rolling shutters are constructed from high-quality
            materials and finished with a durable powder coating. This process
            not only enhances their appearance but also provides a protective
            layer that resists chipping, fading, and corrosion.

            suitable lubricant to the tracks and moving parts to ensure smooth
            operation.
