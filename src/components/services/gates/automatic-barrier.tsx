          <div style={{ lineHeight: "30px" }}>
            Automatic barriers are mechanical gates that raise and lower to
            control vehicle access to specific areas. These barriers can be
            operated through various methods, including remote controls, key
            cards, or integrated access control systems. Automatic barriers are
            typically made from durable materials, ensuring longevity and
            reliable performance in high-traffic environments. Designed for both
            safety and security, these barriers prevent unauthorized entry while
            allowing authorized vehicles easy access.
